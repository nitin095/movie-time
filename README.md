# Movie-Time
Search movies, series, episodes and games using OMBd API.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Jquery
- Bootstrap

## Problem Statement -
Check out the following open API url - http://www.omdbapi.com/
As a solution to this problem, you are supposed to create an application that enables
user to search movie titles using various parameters - By Imdb Id or title or year.
It should have only one view containing a search screen which enables users to provide
these inputs. You have to write Jquery code to change the requests according to
options selected by user and show the response received(search results) by the API in
form of cards containing all the information available in the response. If you receive a
poster image, you have to display that as well and if its not available, it should display a
dummy picture.
You may refer the API documentation given on the page for your references and take
help from them as well. As instructed on this page, you have to generate a free API key
to use this API.

Note - Response may contain different types of values in the JSON array. Please make
sure you are handling all of them correctly.

Here are some important points -
  1) You are free to allowed to do design changes - layout, colors, font, icon etc. Extra
  points will be given for creativity.
  2) You may use bootstrap and related components for layout design.
  3) Your web pages must be fully responsive
